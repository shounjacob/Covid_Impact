## OVERVIEW
The purpose of this project is to study the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic had on different parts of the world. 

**NOTE:** *We will be using SQL queries, Excel and Tableau for this project.*

### STEP 1: SQL QUERIES
After importing the given dataset into SQL and getting the data into a database, we will now perform the following steps.

1. We first check to see the death percentage (Total_Deaths/Total_Cases) in the U.S.A.

2. Then, we look at which countries are worst infected (highest infection rate).

3. Then, we look at which countries have the highest COVID-related deaths.

4. Then, we look at which countries have the highest infection count (most number of cases).

5. Then, we look at the countries with the highest death count per population.

6. Then, we break it down by continent.

#### PREPARING EXCEL FILES FOR OUR TABLEAU VISUALIZATION
Here are the queries we use to prepare our datasets for the Tableau visualizations:

### STEP 2: TABLEAU

In the first worksheet, I displayed the "Total Cases", "Total Deaths", and the "Death Percentage".

In the second worksheet, I displayed the Death Count by Continent, in descending order. I used a bar chart to do this.

In the third worksheet, I displayed the "Percentage of Population Infected" for the whole world, using an *orange-gold* color scheme on a world map to represent the varying impact the virus had on different countries across the world.

And finally, in the fourth worksheet, I displayed the "Estimated vs Actual % Infected" for the top 5 countries.
