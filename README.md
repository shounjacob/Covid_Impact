## OVERVIEW
The purpose of this project is to study the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic had on different parts of the world. 

**NOTE:** *We will be using SQL queries, Excel and Tableau for this project.*

### STEP 1: SQL QUERIES
After importing the given dataset into SQL and getting the data into a database, we will now perform the following steps.

1. We first check to see the death percentage (Total_Deaths/Total_Cases) in the U.S.A.
