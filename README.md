## OVERVIEW
The purpose of this project is to study the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic had on different parts of the world. 

**NOTE:** *We will be using SQL queries, Excel and Tableau for this project.*

### STEP 1: SQL QUERIES
After importing the given dataset into SQL and getting the data into a database, we will now perform the following steps.

1. We first check to see the death percentage (Total_Deaths/Total_Cases) in the U.S.A.

2. Then, we look at which countries are worst infected (highest infection rate).

3. Then, we look at which countries have the highest COVID-related deaths.

4. Then, we look at which countries have the highest infection count (most number of cases).

5. Then, we look at the countries with the highest death count per population.

6. Then, we break it down by continent.

7. Finally, we look at the global numbers.

#### PREPARING EXCEL FILES FOR OUR TABLEAU VISUALIZATION
Here are the queries we use to prepare our datasets for the Tableau visualizations:
